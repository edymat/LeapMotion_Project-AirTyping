LeapMotion_Project-AirTyping - Faculty-PSIOC


This is an faculty project based on an LeapMotionplatform. The ideea of the project is air-typing(bassicaly writing through the air).
For this I've created an virtual keyboard on python and used python language also and for commanding the device.
This will be used as am mouse and when the mouse hits the keyboard button then an event is enabled.
